Hi! I'm Joe Smith. I'm a software engineer and a writer. I'm currently working at a startup called [Acme](https://acme.com). I'm also a contributor to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator written in Go.

I'm passionate about technology, writing, and education. I'm currently working on a book about how to learn computer science. I'm also working on a book about how to write a book.

I live in San Francisco with my wife Jane and our dog Fluffy.
